# Drum-kit
This project is created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
There are various buttons on the screen that can be clicked using a keyboard or mouse.
Buttons produce different sounds from various items in a Drum kit.
I have worked immensely on creating a good user experience and interface using JS and various color themes.
Sounds and images used in the project are collected from internet sources.
